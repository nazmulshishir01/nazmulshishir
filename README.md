MasterHead
Hi, I'm Rizal 👋
A CSE graduate on the way and a web developer in training based in Dhaka — building my foundation one clean line of code at a time.
I naturally drift toward the uncommon: ideas, tools, and directions that feel slightly off the crowded path.

🚀 Currently exploring Web Dev, AI, and Cybersecurity
🌱 Growing confident with the MERN stack
🌳 Chasing the kinds of adventures that sharpen focus and widen perspective

Still learning, still experimenting — always moving forward.
